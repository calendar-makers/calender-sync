Feature: View events by status on the admin page.
	As an admin user
	So that I can easily switch between events of different status groups
	I want to see the events categorized under past, upcoming, pending, and rejected tabs

Background: Events have already been added to the database
  Given the following events exist:
    | name  | start       | end         | st_number | st_name   | city  | description     | status    |
    | Hike  | Dec-21-2016 | Dec-21-2016 | 1210      | street rd | SF    | A past hike     | past      |
    | Hike1 | Dec-22-2016 | Dec-22-2016 | 1210      | street rd | SF    | A past hike     | past      |
    | Hike2 | Dec-25-2016 | Dec-25-2016 | 1210      | street rd | SF    | A pending hike  | pending   |
    | Hike3 | Dec-26-2016 | Dec-26-2016 | 1210      | street rd | SF    | A pending hike  | pending   |
    | Hike4 | Dec-27-2016 | Dec-27-2016 | 1210      | street rd | SF    | A rejected hike | rejected  |
    | Hike5 | Dec-28-2016 | Dec-28-2016 | 1210      | street rd | SF    | A rejected hike | rejected  |
    | Hike6 | Dec-30-2016 | Dec-30-2016 | 1210      | street rd | SF    | Approved hike   | approved  |
    | Hike7 | Dec-26-2016 | Dec-26-2016 | 1210      | street rd | SF    | Approved hike   | approved  |

    And   I am logged in as the admin
    Then  I see the "Admin" panel
    And   I see the following status tabs: "Upcoming", "Pending", "Rejected", "Past"
    And   the date is "12/25/2016 06:00:00 AM"
    

Scenario: Show upcoming events in ascending order
  Given I press the "Upcoming" tab
  Then  I should only see approved, upcoming events
  And   I should see events with dates after now
  And   I should see "Hike6" before "Hike7"
  And   I should not see events with dates before now

Scenario: Show past events in descending order
  Given I press the "Past" tab
  Then  I should only see past events
  And   I should see "Hike1" before "Hike"
  And   I should see events with dates before now
  And   I should not see events with dates after now

Scenario: Show pending events in ascending order
  Given I press the "Pending" tab
  Then  I should only see pending events
  And   I should see "Hike2" before "Hike3"
  And   I should not see events with dates before now
  
Scenario: Show rejected events in ascending order
  Given I press the "Rejected" tab
  Then  I should only see rejected events
  And   I should see "Hike4" before "Hike5"
