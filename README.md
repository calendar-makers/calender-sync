# Purpose
Nature in the City's mission is to inspire San Francisco to discover local nature.

# History
We were founded in 2005 and work with all ages in San Francisco on habitat restoration, environmental education, and building healthy communities. In 2007, we started the Green Hairstreak Corridor to restore habitat for a locally threatened butterfly, and today the butterfly population is strong. We currently care for 14 public habitat restoration gardens in a roughly 28 square block neighborhood area. We also work in public gardens with volunteers at Adah's Stairway and conserve open space and as well as serve as an environmental education resource throughout San Francisco.

# Goals
The goal of this project is to have a calendar application that displays San Francisco nature events for multiple partner agencies, who can, as users, insert their event information -- so that multiple agency information can be added, edited, and displayed on multiple websites. The problem it addresses is to fix bugs that developed with the last CS 169 calendar sync project and to make the application user friendly and viewable by partner organizations to reach larger audiences. The existing project the students engineered for us can be found here: https://github.com/calendar-makers/calendar-sync

# Key Features
The key features include a simplified user experience, an API that continues to sync with meetup.com, and can also be edited by partners and communicate event details to our partner organizations.

# Devices
Mobile phones, Tablets, Desktops

# Target Audience
The target audience for this project is San Francisco and regional audiences wishing to experience outdoors and local nature events. We estimate the audience being from 1000 to 5000 people annually.

# Why
Making our events and partner events accessible to the public is a time-consuming, often manual process, and we wish to integrate other groups to expand offerings and reach new audiences.
